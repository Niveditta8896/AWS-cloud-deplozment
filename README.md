# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction - AWS EC2 Deployment
This project involves deploying a Machine Learning model for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction using Flask on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Project Overview
Built a CKD prediction model

Deployed it using Flask Web Framework

Hosted on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, t3.micro instance)

Model predicts based on patient parameters whether CKD is likely

## Deployment Steps
Created and configured an EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04)

## Opened ports:

22 (SSH - connect to server)

80 (HTTP - access website)

5000 (Flask app default port)

Connected via SSH using Git Bash

Transferred model files and templates securely using SCP

Installed required Python libraries on EC2

Ran the Flask application and accessed it via EC2 public IP

## Technologies Used
Python

Flask

AWS EC2

SCP (for file transfer)

Git Bash
